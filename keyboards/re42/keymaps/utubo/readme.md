# The leftjp keymap for re42 for ME.

I'll update this key layout on how I feel that day.

Make example for this keyboard (after setting up your build environment):

- append to `../../rules.mk`
```c
SWAP_HANDS_ENABLE = yes
DYNAMIC_MACRO_ENABLE = yes
DYNAMIC_MACRO_NO_NESTING = yes
```

- make
```bash
make re42:utubo
```
